# Task Script Execution

This repository contains a series of cognitive task scripts that were executed on Mac minicomputers (2014 model; 2.8 GHz Intel Core i5, OSX High Sierra v 10.13.6) and displayed on 24-inch ASUS VG248 monitors with a 144Hz refresh rate.

All of the tasks were run with MATLAB 2016b (The MathWorks, Inc., Matick, MA) using custom code and Psychtoolbox87,88. For more details on Psychtoolbox, please visit [http://psychtoolbox.org](http://psychtoolbox.org).

## Compatibility

These scripts have been designed to work with MATLAB 2016b. However, they should also be compatible with newer versions of MATLAB. Please ensure that you have the correct version of MATLAB installed on your machine before attempting to run these scripts.

## Execution

To run the cognitive task scripts, follow the instructions below:

1. Run the batch script, entering the participant number when prompted.
2. The script will then execute all nine tasks in sequence. This process takes approximately two hours to complete.

Please note that if a task does not start automatically, press the 'P' key to initiate it.

## Equipment

For optimal performance, we recommend using a similar setup to ours:

- Computer: Mac minicomputer (2014 model; 2.8 GHz Intel Core i5, OSX High Sierra v 10.13.6)
- Monitor: 24-inch ASUS VG248 (144Hz refresh rate)
- Software: MATLAB 2016b (The MathWorks, Inc., Matick, MA) with Psychtoolbox

Thank you for your interest in our task scripts. We hope they will prove useful in your research.
